RxSwift Riddles
=========

This repository contains some riddles for RxSwift to help you learn and master RxSwift.
This project is a fork from [vanniktech/RxRiddles](https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles) for RxJava. 

Each riddle is in a single file with an accompanying unit test that will check your implementation. Next to the unit test, I have also put up my solution. Note that there are multiple ways to achieve and solve the riddles but usually there's a dedicated operator or function that I want to show you.

The riddles are not sorted in any real preference and I plan to keep it that way. Just start with whichever one you prefer. Riddles with numbers lower than 100 can be solved with a single operator while every other riddle requires multiple operators.

### Contributing

First of all have a look into [vanniktech/RxRiddles](https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles) because this Swift fork is not complete yet.
If you want to contribute into translating, please create a pull request with the riddle number from [vanniktech/RxRiddles](https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles) like `Riddle123`

I'm very open to having some more riddles. Especially some complex common use cases. In case you want to contribute create an issue and let's talk.

I want every riddle to be unique and have as little duplication as possible while also having some actual real-world use case for each riddle in mind. Something you can relate to and hopefully use in your everyday life.
