First of all have a look into [vanniktech/RxRiddles](https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles) because this Swift fork is not complete yet.
If you want to contribute into translating, please create a pull request with the riddle number from [vanniktech/RxRiddles](https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles) like `Riddle123`

I'm very open to having some more riddles. Especially some complex common use cases. In case you want to contribute create an issue and let's talk.

I want every riddle to be unique and have as little duplication as possible while also having some actual real-world use case for each riddle in mind. Something you can relate to and hopefully use in your everyday life.
